        <p>My name is Samuel N. Norte, a third-year college student from Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Sta. Rosa City. I am fond of developing new skills, and taking risk. Through my years of experience which started in Junior High School, I am capable of sharing and inspiring others by doing not the same, but their own method and where they were comfortable. And by the power of art, I am able to release my energy and express my emotion through images, film and music. Having a supportive family and friends made my life more meaningful.<br><br>

            From February 2016 to June 2021 I volunteered in a church organization where I performed as one of the videographer and editor of audio-visual presentation used inside and outside the vicinity. With the help of the church we were able to conduct workshops about editing to young volunteers across the vicariate. <br><br>
            
            As a student, I did not stop from looking for experiences so I joined various organization and competition to hone my skills as a student leader, campus journalist, and volunteer. Ceaselessly learning is my own weapon because everyday is a beginning to continue or start something but you have to stop sometimes and recaliberate your minds to continue your journey.
