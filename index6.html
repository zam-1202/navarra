    <div class="hide">I began playing tabletennis at the age of 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br>and continued through junior high school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        I was able to compete at the District Level,    <br>but there were too many talented players,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         
        <br>so I focused on my other abilities. </div>

    <div class = "b">Eagle</div>
    <div class="hide">Because I have a sense of adventure, I continued to participate in scouting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        that started since elementary school. It also led to a love of outdoors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        and the opportunity to meet individuals from all across the city. I learned<br>
        a lot and had a lot of fun being resourceful. I've attained the Eagle Scout&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        rank, which made me a lot stronger and more capable scout.</div>

    <div class = "c">Camera</div>
    <div class="hide">I first became interested in movies while <br>
        I was in eighth grade, when I was working on a project <br>
        that had to be completed. I've been putting my heart and soul into <br>
        filmmaking since then, and it's gotten me into competitions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        I continue to watch movies for pleasure and as a reference.</div>

    <div class = "d">Newswsw<br>swswswss</div>
    <div class="hide">I entered the field of journalism with no prior experience.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It simply compelled me and my friends to participate.<br>
        Unknowingly, it will lead me on a joyful road <br>
        with some difficult moments. But with this, I aspired  <br>
        to be a journalist but it's not destined for me.</div>


    <img class = "crown" src = "img/facts/crown.png">
    <div class = "e">crownrwrwnrnwnrw</div>
    <div class="hide">I competed in the pageant three times and came in first runner-up each time.<br>
        It was a humorous story about how I didn't receive the crown. It does, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        enhance my confidence and allow me to communicate openly. During that time, <br>
        my given number was eight, which I consider to be my lucky number.</div>


    <img class = "dancer" src = "img/facts/dancer.png">
    <div class = "f">dancececece<br>dancececece<br>dancececece<br></div>
    <div class="hide">I've always enjoyed performing, therefore, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had a passion for dance since I was a child. <br>
        I had these images that my aunt took of me,<br>
        and it was in those photos that I fell in love with<br>
        the color yellow since it was the color of our clothes.</div>

    <div class="hide">Since I was a scout, nature has taught me to appreciate her.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature allows me to let go of bad energy, relax, and think clearly.<br>
        It also brings back wonderful recollections of my scouting days.<br>
        Hiking and relaxing on the beach are two of my favorite activities.</div>
